## How It Works 
![How it Works](images/5.png)

### Step 1: User Registration  
- Users register to the system with a unique username and a password.

![register](videos/register.gif)

### Step 2: User Login  
- Users log in with their registered credentials, then selecting their role as: **Donor** or **Recipient**.

![login donor](videos/donor%20login.gif)

![recipient login](videos/Recipient%20login.gif)

### Step 3: Donor Workflow  
1. **Add Donation**: Donors provide item details (e.g., name, description, quantity, and pickup location).

![add donation](videos/add%20donation.gif)  

2. **View Donations**: Track all donated items and their statuses (available, reserved, etc.).

![add donation](videos/view%20donation.gif)   

3. **Edit Donations**: Modify item details or update pickup location.

![edit donation](videos/edit%20donation.gif) 

4. **Remove Donations**: Remove donated items as long as they are available.

![remove donation](videos/remove%20donation.gif) 

### Step 4: Recipient Workflow  
1. **View Donations**: Recipients browse available donations.

![view available donation](videos/view%20avail%20items.gif) 

2. **Reserve Items**: Reserve an item and specify a pickup time.

![reserve](videos/reserve.gif) 

3. **Track Reservations**: View reserved items and their pickup details.

![view reserve](videos/view%20reserve.gif) 

4. **Remove Reservations**: Remove reserved items.

![remove reserve](videos/remove%20reserve.gif) 

### Step 5: Database Management  
- All user and donation data are stored in MySQL tables, ensuring persistence and integrity.

![sql user](images/sql-user.png)

![sql user](images/sql-donation.png)

### Step 6: Status Updates  
- Reserved items are marked with the recipient's username and pickup schedule.  
- Donors can view the updated status of their donations.

## OOP Principles 
![OOP Principles](images/7.png)

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, ensuring sensitive data is private and accessible through getter and setter methods. 

Example: `User` class `username` and `password`
```java
public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }
}
```
- By making the `username` and `password` fields private and providing public getters and setters, we control how these attributes are accessed and modified.
---
### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class.

Example: `DonationDAO` and `UserDAO` Classes Extending `BaseDAO`

- `BaseDAO.java`
```java
public abstract class BaseDAO {
    private Connection connection;

    public BaseDAO() {
        connection = HearDropDB.getConnection();
    }

    protected abstract Object mapResultSetToObject(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException;

    // Other common CRUD operations
}
```
- `DonationDAO` extends `BaseDAO`
```java
public class DonationDAO extends BaseDAO {

    @Override
    protected Donation mapResultSetToObject(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
        return new Donation(
            rs.getInt("id"),
            rs.getInt("donor_id"),
            rs.getString("item_name"),
            rs.getString("description"),
            rs.getInt("quantity"),
            rs.getString("pickup_location"),
            rs.getString("status"),
            rs.getString("recipient_username"),
            rs.getString("pickup_datetime"),
            rs.getString("donor_username")
        );
    }

    // Other methods specific to donations
}
```
- `UserDAO` extends `BaseDAO`
```java
public class UserDAO extends BaseDAO {

    @Override
    protected User mapResultSetToObject(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
        User user = new User();
        user.setId(rs.getInt("id"));
        user.setUsername(rs.getString("username"));
        user.setPassword(rs.getString("password"));
        return user;
    }

    // Other methods specific to users
}
```
- Both `DonationDAO` and `UserDAO` inherit the common database operations from `BaseDAO` but provide their specific implementations for mapping result sets to their respective objects.
---
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types or objects. Methods in derived classes can override the parent class's methods to provide specific implementations.

Example: `DonorMenu` and `RecipientMenu` overriding `displayMenu` from `BaseMenu`

- `BaseMenu`
```java
public abstract class BaseMenu {
    protected static Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    public abstract void displayMenu();

    public abstract void handleChoice(int choice);

    public void show() {
        while (true) {
            displayMenu();
            System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
            int choice = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

            if (choice == getExitChoice()) {
                return;
            }

            handleChoice(choice);
        }
    }

    protected abstract int getExitChoice();
}

```
- `DonorMenu` and `RecipientMenu` overriding `displayMenu`
```java
public class DonorMenu extends BaseMenu {
    @Override
    public void displayMenu() {
        DesignUtils.printHeader("donor", username);
        System.out.println("\n--- Donor Menu ---\n");
        System.out.println("1. Donate Item");
        System.out.println("2. View My Donated Items");
        System.out.println("3. Edit Donated Items");
        System.out.println("4. Remove Donated Item");
        System.out.println("5. Back to Main Menu");
    }

    @Override
    public void handleChoice(int choice) {
        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                donorService.donateItem(donorId, username);
                break;
            case 2: 
                donorService.viewMyDonatedItems(donorId);
                break;
            case 3:
                donorService.editDonatedItem(donorId);
                break;
            case 4:
                donorService.removeDonatedItem(donorId);
                break;
            default: 
                System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected int getExitChoice() {
        return 5;
    }
}

public class RecipientMenu extends BaseMenu {
    @Override
    public void displayMenu() {
        DesignUtils.printHeader("recipient", recipientUsername);
        System.out.println("\n--- Recipient Menu ---\n");
        System.out.println("1. View Available Items");
        System.out.println("2. Reserve Item");
        System.out.println("3. View My Reserved Items");
        System.out.println("4. Remove Reserved Item");
        System.out.println("5. Back to Main Menu");
    }

    @Override
    public void handleChoice(int choice) {
        switch (choice) {
            case 1: 
                recipientService.viewAvailableItems();
                break;
            case 2: 
                recipientService.reserveItem(recipientUsername);
                break;
            case 3: 
                recipientService.viewMyReservedItems(recipientUsername);
                break;
            case 4: 
                recipientService.removeReservedItem(recipientUsername);
                break;
            default: 
                System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected int getExitChoice() {
        return 5;
    }
}
```
- When calling `show()`
```java
    BaseMenu donorMenu = new DonorMenu(user.getId(), user.getUsername());
    donorMenu.show();

    BaseMenu recipientMenu = new RecipientMenu(user.getUsername());
    recipientMenu.show(); 
```

- By defining `BaseMenu` as the reference type for both `DonorMenu` and `RecipientMenu`, the same interface (i.e., `show()`) can be used to call different implementations of `displayMenu()` and `handleChoice()`, depending on the actual object type. This allows for dynamic behavior, where the menu is displayed differently for donors and recipients, even though they are both being handled by the `BaseMenu` reference.
---
### Abstraction
Abstraction hides implementation details from the user and only exposes essential functionalities.

Example: `BaseDAO` implementing abstraction
```java
public abstract class BaseDAO {
    private Connection connection;

    public BaseDAO() {
        connection = HearDropDB.getConnection();
    }

    protected abstract Object mapResultSetToObject(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException;

    public boolean add(String query, Object... params) {
        try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
            setParameters(stmt, params);
            return stmt.executeUpdate() > 0;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Unable to execute the add operation.");
            logError("Add operation error", e);
        }
        return false;
    }

    public <T> T getById(String query, Class<T> clazz, Object... params) {
        try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
            setParameters(stmt, params);
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            if (rs.next()) {
                return clazz.cast(mapResultSetToObject(rs));
            } else {
                System.out.println("No record found for the given criteria.");
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Unable to retrieve the record.");
            logError("GetById operation error", e);
        }
        return null;
    }

    // Other CRUD methods
}

```
- `DonationDAO` implementing mapResultSetToObject method
```java
public class DonationDAO extends BaseDAO {

    @Override
    protected Donation mapResultSetToObject(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
        return new Donation(
            rs.getInt("id"),
            rs.getInt("donor_id"),
            rs.getString("item_name"),
            rs.getString("description"),
            rs.getInt("quantity"),
            rs.getString("pickup_location"),
            rs.getString("status"),
            rs.getString("recipient_username"),
            rs.getString("pickup_datetime"),
            rs.getString("donor_username")
        );
    }

    // Other methods specific to donations
}

```

- `BaseDAO` abstracts common database operations like `add`, `getById`, `getList`, `update`, and `remove`, but the actual logic of mapping a `ResultSet` to a specific object (like `Donation` or `User`) is left to be implemented by subclasses. This approach encapsulates database operations while allowing specific entity classes to define how their data is mapped from the database.

## SDG Implementation 
![SDG Implementation](images/10.png)

### This project focuses on two key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

1. **Zero Hunger (SDG 2)**: 
   - **Facilitates Equitable Distribution**: HearDrop helps bridge the gap between donors and recipients, ensuring that food and essential resources are distributed to those who need them most, thus contributing to the eradication of hunger.
   - **Community Support**: By creating a platform for resource sharing, it empowers communities to support each other, enhancing food security and reducing hunger in vulnerable populations.
   - **Local Engagement**: Encourages local involvement and volunteerism, fostering a sense of community and collective effort towards ending hunger.

2. **Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12)**: 
   - **Minimizes Waste**: HearDrop promotes the efficient use of resources by redirecting surplus food and goods from donors to recipients, thus minimizing waste and promoting sustainability.
   - **Encourages Sustainable Practices**: By facilitating the donation and reuse of items, it supports sustainable consumption patterns, reducing the environmental impact of waste.
   - **Resource Optimization**: Helps optimize the use of available resources, ensuring that useful items are not discarded but instead serve to meet the needs of others.

### How HearDrop Achieves These Goals:

- **User-Friendly Platform**: Provides an intuitive and accessible platform for users to donate and receive items easily, ensuring that the process of sharing resources is seamless and efficient.
- **Tracking and Reporting**: Implements tracking of donations and their impact, allowing users to see the tangible benefits of their contributions and encouraging more consistent and meaningful participation.
- **Educational Outreach**: Raises awareness about the importance of zero hunger and responsible consumption through educational materials and community engagement, fostering a culture of sustainability and empathy.

## About the Developer

Hey there! I'm **Denrei**, the sole developer behind HearDrop. HearDrop was born because of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. I was tasked to create a console program that would adhere OOP principles while attaining Sustainable Development Goals. So I did, and it has been a blast creating this project that could potentially be able to help not only me from my academics but also to the community.

I designed HearDrop to facilitate resource sharing within communities, promoting sustainability and helping those in need. Although it only still has the basic components that I have planned on making, I'm passionate about developing it, and finishing it up to this point reflects that commitment.

Developing this project has taught me a lot about the intricacies of software development, from database management to logic. Each step has been a learning experience and at times has really put my patience to the test, and it has pushed me to refine my skills and think critically about how best to serve the needs of users.

I think I have said too much, anyway, thank you for taking the time to explore my project! This project represents not just a culmination of my coursework, but a stepping stone towards future endeavors in tech and community service and I hope by the time I come back here again, I have improved and be able to do better.

Best regards, **Denrei Samuel Angeles**
